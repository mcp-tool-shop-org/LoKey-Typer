# LoKey Typer

A calm typing practice app with ambient soundscapes, personalized daily sets, and no accounts required.

## What it is

LoKey Typer is a typing practice app built for adults who want quiet, focused sessions without gamification, leaderboards, or distractions. It functions more like a musical instrument than a game: responsive, consistent, and tuned for flow state.

All data stays on your device. No accounts. No cloud. No tracking.

## v1.1.0 Highlights (Audio Mastery)

- **Daily Set**: A personalized 3-exercise routine generated fresh every day.
- **Streaks & Progress**: Track your consistency and visualize WPM trends over weeks.
- **Perfect Runs**: Detailed integrity checks where every keystroke matters.
- **Studio Audio Engine**:
  - **Limiter**: Zero-artifact typing even at 140+ WPM.
  - **Cinematic Ducking**: Background music automatically lowers when you type and swells when you pause.
  - **Recovery**: Self-healing audio system for robust browser support.
