LoKey Typer is designed to be usable without relying on sound, animation, or hidden cues.

## Sound is optional

- The app remains fully usable with sound off.
- No progress or state is conveyed only through audio.
- Ambient sound can be turned off at any time.

## Screen Reader Mode

When Screen Reader Mode is enabled, LoKey Typer automatically disables ambient sound. No audio-only cues are used for state changes. All information is available through the DOM and ARIA attributes.

## Reduced Motion

When Reduced Motion is enabled, dynamic behavior is reduced or removed. Ambient macro evolution is disabled (micro drift only). The app stays conservative and predictable.

## Cognitive predictability

- No surprise sounds.
- No notification-like cues embedded in ambience.
- Defaults aim to stay quiet, predictable, and non-fatiguing.

## Design commitment

If a setting or feature makes the app harder to use, that is a bug. LoKey Typer is built for extended practice sessions, and accessibility is enforced at the system level -- not bolted on as an afterthought.
