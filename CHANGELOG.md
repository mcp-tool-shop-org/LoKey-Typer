# Changelog

## 1.1.0 — 2026-02-14

**Audio Mastery Update**: transformed "typing sounds" into a dynamic, instrument-grade audio engine.

### Features
- **Cinematic Audio Ducking**: Ambient music now intelligently "ducks" (lowers volume) during typing bursts and swells back during pauses, creating a movie-score focus effect.
- **Smart Limiter**: New audio scheduler eliminates "machine gun" artifacts during rapid typing or rollover.
- **Prewarm System**: Eliminated first-key latency; audio engine now preloads buffers on user engagement.
- **Audio Mix Presets**: Added "Crisp" (Focus), "Studio" (Balanced), and "Relax" (Cinematic) presets in Settings.
- **Recovery Tools**: Added manual audio system recovery in Diagnostics for browsers that aggressively suspend audio contexts.
