# How Personalization Works (Plain Language)

LoKey Typer adapts in small ways based on your recent sessions.

It’s designed to be:

- optional
- local-only
- quiet and non-intrusive
- suitable for long sessions

## What it does

- Picks a “Today’s Set” that stays stable for the day.
- Avoids repeating the same exercises too often.
- Includes a small amount of targeted practice when a pattern shows up in recent runs.

## What it does not do

- No accounts.
- No cloud profile.
- No hidden scoring system.
- No promises about productivity or cognition.

## Your control

You can turn sound off, adjust ambient settings, or ignore personalization entirely.
The app remains fully usable either way.
