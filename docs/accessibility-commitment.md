# Accessibility Commitment

LoKey Typer is designed to be usable without relying on sound, animation, or hidden cues.

## Sound is optional

- The app remains fully usable with sound off.
- No progress or state is conveyed only through audio.
- Ambient sound can be turned off at any time.

## Accessibility settings are enforced

When accessibility settings are enabled, LoKey Typer prioritizes stability and clarity:

- Screen Reader Mode automatically disables ambient sound.
- Reduced Motion reduces or removes dynamic behavior.

## Designed for long sessions

LoKey Typer is built for extended practice.
Defaults aim to stay quiet, predictable, and non-fatiguing.

If a setting or feature makes the app harder to use, that’s a bug.
