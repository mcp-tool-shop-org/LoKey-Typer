# Sound Philosophy

Most typing tools treat sound as an afterthought — a click, a chime, or background music.

We didn’t.

## An environment, not a playlist

LoKey Typer doesn’t play songs or loops.
It creates a quiet, evolving acoustic environment designed to stay out of the way while you type.

There’s no rhythm to follow, no beat to lock onto, and no track to repeat.

## Designed for focus, not stimulation

Our ambient soundscape avoids:

- rhythm and tempo
- sudden changes
- attention-grabbing moments

Instead, it evolves gradually over time — subtle enough that you may not notice it changing, but varied enough that it never feels repetitive.

## Typing always comes first

Keystroke feedback matters.
That’s why ambient sound is mixed to never mask typing sounds, and never reacts to your typing rhythm.

The soundscape supports the work — it doesn’t compete with it.

## Comfortable for long sessions

LoKey Typer’s ambience is designed for extended use.
Volume levels are kept low and stable, and frequency ranges associated with fatigue are avoided.

If sound ever becomes tiring, distracting, or unnecessary, it can be turned off instantly.

## Accessibility is built in

When accessibility settings are enabled:

- ambient sound is reduced or disabled automatically
- no information is conveyed only through audio

Sound is optional. The app remains fully usable without it.

## What we don’t claim

We don’t promise productivity hacks, brainwave tuning, or cognitive optimization.

Our goal is simpler: to create a calm, unobtrusive environment where typing feels easier to sustain.

## The best outcome

If you forget the sound is there — until you turn it off — then it’s doing its job.

### One-line version

LoKey Typer uses a non-rhythmic, evolving ambient soundscape designed to support focus without distraction.
