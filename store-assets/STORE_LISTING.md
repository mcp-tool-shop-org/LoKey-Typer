## App Name

LoKey Typer

## Short Description

A calm typing practice app with ambient soundscapes, personalized daily sets, and no accounts required.

## Full Description

LoKey Typer is a typing practice app built for adults who want quiet, focused sessions without gamification, leaderboards, or distractions.

Choose from multiple practice modes:

- Focus: Calm, curated exercises for building rhythm and accuracy.
- Real-Life: Practice with emails, code snippets, and everyday text.
- Competitive: Timed sprints with personal bests for those who want speed.
- Daily Set: A fresh set of exercises generated each day, adapted to your recent sessions.

The app includes an ambient sound system that creates a non-rhythmic, evolving soundscape designed to support focus without distraction. Sound is always optional and never required.

All data stays on your device. There are no accounts, no cloud sync, and no telemetry. Preferences, run history, and personal bests are stored locally in your browser.

LoKey Typer is a progressive web app that works offline after the first load.
